# Planets
A BBC BASIC program to simulate the solar system

This program was published in the February 1998 edition of Acorn User. To run it, you will need to either use an actual Acorn computer (such as the RISC PC), or install an emulator such as [RPCEmu](https://www.marutan.net/rpcemu/index.php).
